Terms of Service (Store) — ZoneGaming / store.zonegaming.net

Effective Date: February 19, 2026
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of store.zonegaming.net and any related services provided by ZoneGaming (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “ZoneGaming”), including Hytale server hosting and related hosting products (“Services”). By purchasing, accessing, or using our Services, you agree to these Terms.

1) Definitions

“Services” means any hosting, server provisioning, server panels, add-ons, and related products sold through store.zonegaming.net.

“Customer” / “you” means the person or entity purchasing or using the Services.

“Content” means any files, mods, plugins, scripts, configs, saves, logs, data, or other material you upload, generate, or store using the Services.

2) Eligibility & Account Responsibility

You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your state) to purchase Services. You are responsible for:

maintaining account security (passwords, API keys, panel access),

all activity occurring under your account,

ensuring your contact and billing information is accurate.

3) Service Description

We provide Hytale server hosting and related features. Service specifics (plan limits, CPU/RAM/storage, locations, included features) are shown at purchase time and may be updated as our infrastructure evolves.

4) Orders, Billing, and Renewals

Billing Cycle: Services are billed on the cycle shown at checkout (monthly or otherwise).

Auto-Renewal: If enabled, you authorize us (or our payment processor) to charge your payment method automatically at renewal.

Failed Payments: If a payment fails, we may suspend the Service until payment is received. If not paid within a reasonable time, we may terminate the Service and delete data (Section 10).

Taxes: You are responsible for any applicable U.S. sales tax or other taxes (if charged).

5) Refund Policy

Unless required by applicable U.S. law, purchases are non-refundable once provisioning begins, because server resources are allocated immediately.

We may issue refunds or account credits at our discretion in limited cases (for example):

duplicate billing caused by our system,

inability to provision the purchased Service due to our fault (confirmed by us).

Chargebacks / Payment Disputes: If you initiate a chargeback or dispute without contacting support first, we may suspend Services immediately and terminate your account. You agree to contact support to attempt resolution before filing a dispute.

6) Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

You agree not to use the Services to:

violate any federal, state, or local U.S. law,

infringe intellectual property rights (including distributing pirated content),

distribute malware, ransomware, botnets, or unauthorized crypto-mining,

conduct DDoS attacks or network abuse,

host or distribute content that is illegal, exploitative, or encourages violence,

attempt unauthorized access to systems, accounts, or networks,

resell or repackage the Services without written permission (unless explicitly allowed).

We may suspend or terminate Services for AUP violations (Section 10) and may cooperate with lawful requests.

7) Game / Platform Rules (Hytale)

You are responsible for ensuring your server and Content comply with:

Hytale’s terms, guidelines, and policies,

mod/plugin licensing,

community safety practices for your players.

You are solely responsible for administering and moderating your server.

8) Resource Limits & Fair Use

Plans include defined allocations (RAM/CPU/storage/ports). You may not exceed limits or use Services in a way that harms platform stability or other customers. We may throttle usage, require an upgrade, or suspend abusive usage.

9) Uptime, Maintenance, and Support

We aim to provide reliable hosting but do not guarantee uninterrupted uptime. Maintenance may be scheduled or emergency. Support is best-effort via the channels listed on the site.

10) Suspension, Termination, and Data Deletion

We may suspend or terminate Services immediately if:

payment is past due,

you violate these Terms/AUP,

your activity threatens security or stability,

we receive a lawful request requiring action.

Data Retention: After termination or prolonged non-payment, we may delete your server and Content. You are responsible for backups.

11) Backups & Data Responsibility

Backups are not guaranteed unless explicitly included in your plan. Even if provided, they may be limited in frequency and retention. You should maintain independent backups of important data.

12) IP Address & Network Changes

IPs/ports may change due to maintenance, migration, abuse mitigation, or infrastructure needs. Permanent/static IPs are not guaranteed unless explicitly sold.

13) Intellectual Property

We retain all rights to our website, branding, and platform software. You retain ownership of your Content. You grant us a limited license to host and process your Content solely to provide the Services.

14) Privacy

Our handling of personal information is described in our Privacy Policy (if posted). By using the Services, you agree to our collection and use of data for billing, account management, service operation, and security.

15) Disclaimers

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER U.S. LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

16) Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ZONEGAMING WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF PROFITS/REVENUE/DATA.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 30 DAYS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

(Some states do not allow certain limitations, so these may not apply to you.)

17) Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ZoneGaming and its owners/operators from claims and expenses arising from your use of the Services, your Content, your violations of these Terms, or your server’s operation.

18) Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms at any time by posting a revised version with a new effective date. Continued use after changes means you accept them.

19) Governing Law & Venue (U.S.)

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Any dispute will be brought in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, unless applicable law requires otherwise.
